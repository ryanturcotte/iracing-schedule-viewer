# iRacing Schedule Viewer and Spreadsheet Creator

Live Site: https://ryanturcotte.github.io/iracing-schedule-viewer/

This is a successor to the Powershell app at https://github.com/ryanturcotte/iracing-calendar-spreadsheet

Built as an experiment in AI code creation. Almost all of the code is by Google Gemini, with the exception of debugging, troubleshooting, and some future targetted features (track name minimizing logic).
